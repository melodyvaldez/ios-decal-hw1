//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: No. "String?" is an optional String, meaning that it can return "nil." On the other hand, "String!" is an implicitly unwrapped optional, so we assume that it does not have "nil." If we pass in "nil" to the init function, then there would be an error since the variables wordA and wordB cannot be "nil."


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    static func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: The index "i" changes its value, so it should be "var" instead of "let" since it is not a constant. The function also needs to be static since it is a class method. It also needs to return true in the end


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]()
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (_, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: countLetters was only declared, but not initialized. The function should return true at the end instead of nil, since nil is not a boolean. The variable "letter" wasn't used in the last for loop, so it was changed to "_". This is an instance method, so you don't need "class" in the function signature.
